Narrative: In this project, I enhanced a course catalog by implementing a self-balancing Redâ€“Black Tree to replace a basic BST. This update maintains logarithmic time complexity for insertion, search, and traversal through automatic rotations and color adjustments. I utilized modern C++ practices by managing child nodes with std::shared_ptr and parent pointers with std::weak_ptr, which helped prevent memory issues. Additionally, I integrated CSV file input for course data and included performance tests to evaluate operation efficiencies.

Through these improvements, I demonstrated strong skills in algorithm design and modern C++ programming, file I/O handling, and performance optimization. This work aligns with course outcomes by effectively applying theoretical data structure concepts to a practical problem, utilizing advanced programming techniques, and validating system performance through rigorous testing.

Overall, this project not only improves the course catalog's efficiency and robustness but also highlights my capability to solve complex problems while meeting and exceeding course objectives.
