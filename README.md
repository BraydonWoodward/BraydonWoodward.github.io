#### Narrative:
This artifact is my enhanced Course Tree application, a self-balancing Red–Black Tree designed to manage an academic course catalog for ABCU's Computer Science department. Originally created in December 2023, I revisited and significantly improved the project in March 2025. In this updated version, I replaced the prior binary search tree implementation, which was prone to degeneration and stack overflows when handling sorted data, with a robust Red–Black Tree that leverages modern C++ smart pointers for safe memory management. I chose to include this project in my ePortfolio because it not only showcases my abilities in implementing advanced data structures and algorithms, but it also demonstrates a concrete understanding of object-oriented design, resource management, and performance optimization. Key components, such as tree rotations, insertion fixup, and efficient in-order traversal, show my competency in utilizing complex logic to maintain the tree’s balanced properties. The enhancements significantly improved the artifact by ensuring worst-case logarithmic performance, even with large datasets, and by mitigating common pitfalls like deep recursion errors.

The process of enhancing this artifact was both challenging and enriching. I began by examining the weaknesses of the original design. Specifically, the susceptibility to degeneration due to sorted input—and identified the Red–Black Tree algorithm as the optimal solution. Implementing smart pointers introduced a modern approach to memory safety in C++; however, it also required a careful adjustment of pointer semantics, particularly when managing parent-child relationships using std::weak_ptr for parent pointers to avoid cyclic references. Through iterative testing and incorporating feedback from my instructors, I refined the design, added thorough error handling for file I/O and user input, and ensured that each component functioned as intended. Although I feel confident in the improvements made, I recognize that further work could be done to extend the project's functionality, such as adding deletion operations to the tree. Overall, this project reflects my growth in software development and my ability to take feedback, iteratively improve my design, and implement sophisticated solutions in modern C++.
